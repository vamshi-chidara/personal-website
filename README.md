# Portfolio
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is designed to showcase my work as a web developer and to provide information about my skills and experience.

The website features a clean design and includes the resume section where visitors can browse my projects and view details about each one. 

You can view the live version of the website [here](https://www.vamshichidara.com/). I plan to continue updating and improving the site in the future, so stay tuned for new features and content!"
